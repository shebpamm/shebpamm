## Hello! I'm Erik, an aspiring network engineer :wave:

**[ [website] ] [ [blog] ] [ [linkedin] ]**

### I'm a 20 year old Information Technology student from Finland

- 🐣 Joined GitHub when I was 11
- 🐤 First commit at 14 years old
- 🐧 Discovered Linux and got hooked!

I've been interested in programming for a long time and my main interests have been in **IT Infrastructure Management** and **System Administration**. 

I do love programming and do that too. Most of the time though I'm configuring my homelab.
